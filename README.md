# MSMP
This assignment is to examine the performance of a product duplicate detection method MSMP+ (Multi-component Simiarity Method with Pre-selection based on LSH) with a revised method for model words extraction. 

## main.py
In this file, we complete the main taks for this assignment. Data retriving and bootstrapping are completed, and the final performance of both LSH and MSM is obtained.

## msmp.py
In this file, we define the necessary functions needed for MSMP. Functions for LSH, MSM, and the hierarchical clustering method are defined.

## msm.py
In this file, necessary functions are defined for MSM.

## dataprocessing.py
In this file, we define functions used for data processing including data cleaning and model words extraction.
